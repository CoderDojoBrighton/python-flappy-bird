# Part 1 - {{< param "title" >}}

- Press the New button in Mu to open a new file and enter the following lines:
```python
TITLE = 'Flappy Bird'
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 708
```

- Press **Save** and save the file as flappybird.py
- press **Play** to see what this code does.

You should see an new empty window appear.

*Can you guess what each line of code does?*

- Press the Stop button to end your program. You have to do this even if you closed the new window.
- Try changing the numbers on each line to try to work out what each line does.

*How big or small can you make the window?*

**If you make it too big the window might not appear at all. If you make it too small you might not be able to find it! In this case just press the Stop button.**
